Assignment Title: Real-Time Order Management System with AWS and CI/CD
🎯 Objective:
Build and deploy a full-stack Order Management System using the following stack:

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Spring Boot (Java)

AWS Services: DynamoDB, S3, SNS

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins

🛠️ Backend Requirements (Spring Boot)
🔹 Entities:
Order

orderId (UUID)

customerName (String)

orderAmount (Double)

orderDate (ISO Timestamp)

invoiceFileUrl (String – S3 URL)

🔹 Endpoints:
POST /orders
→ Create a new order: store in DynamoDB, upload PDF to S3, send SNS notification

GET /orders/{id}
→ Fetch order by ID

GET /orders
→ List all orders

☁️ AWS Integration:
DynamoDB: Save order data

S3: Upload invoice PDF and store its URL

SNS: Publish a message upon order creation (simulate email/SMS)

💡 Optional Features:
Swagger UI for API documentation

JWT Authentication for securing endpoints

🖥️ Frontend Requirements (React.js)
🔹 Pages:
Dashboard (/)

Displays all orders in a table

Columns: Order ID, Customer, Amount, Date, Invoice Link

Create Order (/create)

Form fields:

Customer Name

Order Amount

Upload Invoice (PDF)

On submission, POST to /orders

Order Detail (/orders/:id)

View full order details

Download invoice

🔹 UI Features:
Responsive design

Toast notifications

Clean design using Bootstrap, Tailwind, or Material UI

🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Options
Option A: GitHub Actions

.github/workflows/deploy.yml should:

Option B: Jenkins

Git clone + Maven build

Test and deploy using AWS CLI

📦 Deliverables
